# BMI_Calculator
The BMI Calculator was a project assigned from the ECE 1310 course at Cal Poly Pomona. This program is a basic C++ BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that takes a user’s height (in feet and inches) and weight (in pounds), validates the inputs, and then calculates and displays the user’s BMI along with the corresponding weight category. The program checks for invalid values—such as unrealistic height or weight—and exits with an error message if the input is outside the allowed range. When valid data is entered, it converts the user’s height to total inches, applies the standard BMI formula using the U.S. customary units conversion factor (703), and classifies the result as Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, or Obese.
